          <b><i>We have got you covered.</i><br /> Find out the most common Mechanic Scams mentioned below:</b><br/> <br />
          
          <ol>
            <li> <b>The Additional Problems - </b>Ever wondered, after giving your car to the best authorized service center, your car mysteriously uncovers problems.? Dishonest Mechanics will always end up telling that they have found the additional problems & did expensive repairs because it was necessary.This will result in massive unnecessary bills. </li>
            <li> <b>Cheap Spare Parts- </b>The Gray Market is a huge playground for dishonest Mechanics which saves them a lot of money. They often tend to replace the parts with a duplicate in order to con a lot of money from the customer. These spares will not come with any warranty and will also tend to wear down much sooner which will eventually lead to the need of the Mechanic Again. </li>
            <li> <b>Broken/ Old Parts Never Returned - </b> In support of point (2), once the part which is broken or needs to be fixed is replaced, the old parts are never returned back or shown to the customer. This unwillingness often shows that they are hiding something about the non- existent repairs. A good Mechanic will not just show you the problem, but explain in simple words about how the solution will be provided. </li>  
            <li> <b>Axle Boots are Broken - </b> This is a very common scam! Axle boots are broken and the grease has leaked out making your car unsafe to drive. CV Axle serve as a link between your car’s engine and the wheels to transfer torque from the drivetrain to your wheels to make the car run. There are joints to ensure that the axle can move freely even when the car is being steered left or right . And at these joints are the rubber boots to contain grease for lubricating and preventing dirt. And if this wears down, the axle assembly will make enough indiciation which will catch your attention. </li>
            <li> <b>Inflated Prices - </b> Beware of dishonest repair shops. They often tend to give you initial quotes which are cheaper to get a green signal from the customer’s side, but when you come to pick up your car, the final pricing will be way higher as compared to the initial one . </li>
            <li> <b>Unresponsive to requests - </b> It is pretty often for car dealership & repair shops to not be responsive enough once the service has been taken care off. It is quite often seen that once your car is given to service at a specific repair shop, they stop answering and taking any special requests. It is highly unprofessional as that is the last place you would like to leave your car at. </li>
            <li> <b>Accepting Only Cash - </b> This is another common scam done by Repair Shops and Auto detailers where they disagree to accept any other forms of payments apart from cash or direct individual online transfer. This often saves the trail and the repair shops can over charge.</li>
            <li> <b>Long Waiting Hours - </b> There can definitely be delays for various reasons, but if your mechanic is doing it constantly there is a serious problem ! We can always understand the late shipment or even the low health of the Mechanic but it is often because they could have easily done some damage to your car, and is buying time from you to cover this up without getting noticed. </li>
